# naturalneighbor

2D Natural Neighbor Interpolation (NNI) library for Rust.

The implementation of this library is based on '[A Fast and Accurate Algorithm for Natural Neighbor Interpolation](
https://gwlucastrig.github.io/TinfourDocs/NaturalNeighborTinfourAlgorithm/index.html)' by G.W. Lucas.

This is a subproject for the [fastlem](https://github.com/TadaTeruki/fastlem).

## Installation

```
[dependencies]
naturalneighbor = "1.1.3"
```

## Benchmark

Benchmarking is available with [criterion](https://crates.io/crates/criterion).
```
$ cargo bench
```

### Result

Estimated time per 1 interpolation for 2D NNI with 1000, 10000, and 100000 sites.

CPU: 11th Gen Intel i7-11390H (8) @ 5.000GHz<br>
